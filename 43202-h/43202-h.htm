<p style="text-align: center">[Reprinted from the &ldquo;S. <span

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> everyone has need of charity,
everyone exercises charity, and most of us receive charity, the
subject is of personal application and importance to us
all.&nbsp; This is the case when charity is abstractly regarded;
but when we approach the consideration of the charities of our
own parish, those which we are bound to support and upon which we
have individually a claim, our subject must excite the keenest
interest.&nbsp; Too much cannot be known about them in order that
their benefits may be distributed amongst the fittest subjects
and most deserving persons that can be found; and in order that
those of us who are blessed with means may learn how carefully
and fruitfully any benefaction we may make in the future will be
utilised and bestowed, if placed in the hands of those
administering the charities already established in our
parish.</p>
<p>Perhaps the point which will strike you most, when you have
learned what I have to tell you this evening of the charities of
Kensington, is the circumstance that, from small sums of money
left for purposes of charity, great and ever growing results may
spring, fulfilling purposes of good far beyond the most sanguine
anticipations in which the original donors could have ever
indulged.</p>
<p>Old Faulkner, to whose quaint and interesting history of
Kensington I would refer all lovers of antiquity and curious
anecdote, writing in 1820, says: &ldquo;The amount of
benefactions to this parish is highly creditable to the humanity
of the original founders, and it is a pleasing as well as an
important part of the duty of the historian to record these;
perhaps in few parishes in the kingdom have they been more
scrupulously observed, or more faithfully
administered.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pleasing as it was to Faulkner seventy
years ago to remark upon the then condition of the parish
charities, it will be yet more gratifying to us to observe at the
present time how greatly they have developed, and how admirably
they have been fostered, improved, and administered.&nbsp;
Seventy years ago Kensington was really rural, containing only
three or four hamlets, or assemblages of dwellings, a few large
houses with grounds, some celebrated nursery and market gardens,
and a few distinguished inhabitants.&nbsp; This is what Tickell,
the poet, says about it:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here, while the town in damp and darkness
lies,<br />
They (at Kensington he means) breathe in sunshine and see azure
skies.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What Kensington is now we all know; would that its charities
had grown in proportion to its population.&nbsp; Perhaps if
through your kind exertions more attention can be drawn to the
subject they may enlarge, and the history of the future charities
of Kensington prove as creditable as the past.</p>
<p>In the year 1807 a joint committee of the trustees of the
poor, and of the vestry, was appointed to consider and report,
amongst other subjects, upon the charities of the parish; and
that committee undertook a most careful and exhaustive inquiry
into the matter, the results of which were recorded in &ldquo;The
Report of the Kensington Committee of the 30th October,
1810.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is needless to say that this report has now
become a very rare document.&nbsp; Fortunately a copy has been
preserved in the archives of the vestry, and to that
copy&mdash;through the kindness of the vestry clerk, although
with all due precautions to its safe preservation&mdash;I have
had access; and thus we are enabled to make an interesting
comparison between the condition of the parish and its charities
then and now.</p>
<p>It appears from this report (which is as able a document as I
ever read) <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>that the parish in 1810 contained about 1,500 rateable
houses, and an estimated population of 10,000 souls.</p>
<p>It appears from the report to the vestry of the Medical
Officer of Health to the parish for the year 1888, dated July,
1889, that at the middle of 1888 the inhabited houses in the
parish numbered 21,566, with an estimated population of 177,000
persons.</p>
<p>In 1810 the main charity of the parish was then, as now, the
Campden Bequests.&nbsp; There were also the Methwold Almshouses,
the Parish Free School, and some various other bequests of
comparatively small amount for specific objects, or for the
purposes of the poor of the parish generally.</p>
<p>What are known as the Campden Bequests have a most interesting
history, and have grown from very small beginnings into a wealthy
institution.&nbsp; They are alike the most ancient and most
important of the parish charities.</p>
<p>In 1629, Baptist Viscount Campden, of the family which built
Campden House, which has within the last sixty years extended its
name to the hill on which its stands, bequeathed the sum of
&pound;200 to two gentlemen, and to the churchwardens of
Kensington from time to time, &ldquo;in trust to be employed for
the good and benefit of the poor of the parish for ever as the
trustees should think fit to establish.&rdquo;&nbsp; This sum of
&pound;200, with &pound;20 added from accumulated interest and
otherwise, was in 1635 expended in the purchase of two closes of
land containing fourteen acres, called Charecrofts, situate near
Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush Green, a very fortunate investment, as we
shall presently find.</p>
<p>Elizabeth, Viscountess Dowager Campden, the widow of the
former donor, in 1644 bequeathed another sum of &pound;200 to Sir
John Thorowgood and sundry parishioners, and to the churchwardens
of Kensington, &ldquo;upon trust that they should within eighteen
months purchase lands of the clear yearly value of &pound;10;
one-half whereof should be applied from time to time for ever for
and towards the better relief of the most poor and needy people
<i>that be of good life and conversation</i> that should be
inhabiting the said parish of Kensington; and the other half
thereof should be applied yearly for ever to put forth one poor
boy or more living in said parish to be apprenticed.&nbsp; The
said &pound;5 due to the poor to be paid to them half-yearly for
ever at Lady Day and Michaelmas in the church or the porch
thereof at Kensington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Lady Campden&rsquo;s &pound;200 a close called
Butt&rsquo;s Field was immediately purchased, containing 5 acres
2 roods and 30 perches, and the purchase also included 3 roods to
be taken out of an adjoining field, called the Middle Quale
Field, at the south end of Butt&rsquo;s Field.&nbsp; This
purchase, we shall find, has proved a still more profitable
investment than that of Lord Campden&rsquo;s &pound;200.</p>
<p>The remaining portion of the original property, now known as
the Campden Bequests, is of a still more interesting
character.&nbsp; In 1651, one Thomas Coppin, in consideration of
the sum of &pound;45, sold to the same Sir John Thorowgood and
eleven of the parishioners and their heirs, &ldquo;all that land
with the appurtenances at the gravel pits in Kensington,
containing two acres, in the occupation of Richard
Barton.&rdquo;&nbsp; No trust was declared in this conveyance,
but subsequent occurrences leave no doubt that it was intended
for purposes similar to those provided for by Lord and Lady
Campden&rsquo;s wills.&nbsp; And the purchase having been made so
shortly after the two others, and at a time when the great Oliver
Cromwell was the ruler of the country under the title of
Protector, and when he held property in the parish, added to the
circumstance that the gift was always traditionally ascribed to
him and known as Cromwell&rsquo;s gift, appear to leave no real
doubt that it is to Oliver Cromwell that the parish owes this
addition to the charities.&nbsp; It will be seen that this gift
and purchase has proved no less profitable to the parish than the
two others.</p>
<p>Let us pause for a moment, and see of what the property of the
Campden Bequests then consisted.</p>

<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>Let us
now endeavour to identify these properties.</p>
<p>I can make you understand where Charecrofts is situated by
telling you that the Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush Station of the London
and South Western Railway now occupies a portion of the site.</p>
<p>Butt&rsquo;s Field comprises the frontage to the Kensington
Road extending from Gloucester Road on the west, eastward about
140 feet to Palace Gate, and from the Kensington Road southwards
to and including the whole of the premises known as Kensington
Gate.</p>
<p>The Gravel Pits are now occupied by Clanricarde Gardens, and
the six shops known as Nos. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, High Street,
Notting Hill.</p>
<p>It would take too long to describe the various uses to which
these sites have been put, and all the applications of the income
derived from them.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that the whole was
always conscientiously applied to the purposes intended by their
donors, except, that under an Act of Parliament passed in 1777
the original parish workhouse was built upon that part of
Butt&rsquo;s Field where Kensington Gate now stands, and the Act
provided that the then existing rents of the three estates,
amounting to &pound;54, should be applied to the apprenticing of
poor boys, but that any further rents that might be obtained
beyond that sum should be applied in aid of the parish rates
until the expense incurred in erecting the workhouse should be
discharged.&nbsp; And accordingly they were so applied until Lady
Day of 1816.&nbsp; This, no doubt, was a perversion of the fund,
because, although the workhouse was for the relief of the poor,
still by law all the parishioners were rated for that purpose,
the rich as well as the poor; and in proportion as anyone was
relieved from the payment of rates, so was the money diverted
from the poor intended to be objects of the bounty.&nbsp;
However, this distinction in 1777 escaped attention; but in the
report of 1810, to which I have alluded, the point was strongly
made, and since 1816 the whole income has been applied to its
proper purpose.</p>
<p>As we have seen, in 1777 the total receipts from the lands
were &pound;54.</p>

<p>of which &pound;54 was applied to putting out apprentices,
&pound;29 to pay two remaining annuities; the amount necessary
for building the workhouse having been obtained by the then
fashionable expedient of settling life annuities, while the
balance of &pound;97 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> was applied in aid of
poor rates.</p>
<p>Let me now approach much nearer our own times, and, by
referring to an elaborate report of the trustees of
Campden&rsquo;s Bequest appointed for the purpose in December,
1853, ascertain what was the income derived from these lands in
1854.&nbsp; Among the trustees at that time there were some well
known persons, including the Venerable Archdeacon Sinclair, the
then Vicar of Kensington, who many of us now present can well
remember; the Rev. Dr. Hessey, Vicar of S. Barnabas; Sir Henry
Cole, C.B., well known to many of us in connection with the South
Kensington Museum; the Rev. E. P. Denniss, Vicar of S.
John&rsquo;s, Notting Hill; and Dr. Frost, of Ladbroke Square;
who, if I mistake not, is the same Charles Maynard Frost who yet
remains an active trustee of the charity.</p>

<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>In the
year ending Lady Day, 1853, &pound;253 had been paid in pensions
to poor persons, and &pound;157 10<i>s.</i> applied for
apprenticing poor boys, while &pound;373 1<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>
remained to the credit of the pension fund, and &pound;308
6<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, to the credit of the apprenticeship
fund.</p>
<p>Thus we see that the sum &pound;465 invested in land in the
years 1635 to 1651 produced in 1777 &pound;54; in 1810,
&pound;180 17<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; and in 1853, &pound;677
7<i>s.</i> per annum in rents.</p>
<p>And the application of the funds had, except as regards the
old parish workhouse for the period mentioned above, been in
accordance with the intention of the donors, namely:&mdash;</p>
<p>The income from Lord Campden&rsquo;s Bequest (Charecrofts) in
pensions to the deserving poor of the parish.</p>
<p>From Lady Campden&rsquo;s (Butt&rsquo;s) half in such
pensions, and half in apprenticeships.</p>
<p>And from Cromwell&rsquo;s (Gravel Pits) three-fourths in
pensions, and one-fourth in apprenticeships.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the parish had been increasing greatly in
population.&nbsp; Other churches had been built, and other
congregations than that worshipping at the Parish Church of S.
Mary Abbots had been formed, and districts allotted to
them.&nbsp; Questions arose as to distribution of the charity
funds as between the inhabitants of the various districts, and in
1852 a petition was presented to the Court of Chancery by the
Incumbent and Churchwardens of the District Church at Brompton to
have them settled by the Court under the powers of an Act of
Parliament of 52 George III.&nbsp; And on the 23rd December,
1852, the Court of Chancery made an order directing that the
trustees of the Campden Charities should in future apply the
profits therefrom as they had hitherto been accustomed to do; but
that in future without interfering with any pensions or contracts
of apprenticeship already entered into by them in the proportions
following among the various church districts:&mdash;</p>

<p>Such order, it is evident, must have embarrassed the actions
of the trustees greatly, and considerably interfered with their
judicious application of the charity funds.&nbsp; I have not been
able to refer to the evidence upon which the order was obtained,
but if, on the ground of the distribution of the population of
the parish in 1852 it had any shadow of justice then, it would be
highly unjust now, when the population of the northern half of
the parish, forming the Parliamentary district of North
Kensington, and then comprised in the church districts of S.
John&rsquo;s, Notting Hill, arid S. James&rsquo;, Norland, is
greater than that of all the other districts put together.</p>
<p>Between 1853 and 1879 the income from the Campden Charities
increased from the &pound;667 7<i>s.</i> to about &pound;3,500 a
year.</p>
<p>Several leases of plots of ground had fallen in, and meanwhile
the value of the land had been rising enormously.&nbsp;
Charecrofts, at Shepherd&rsquo;s Bush, formerly a nursery ground,
was in 1864 let on a building lease for a term of ninety-nine
years at a ground rent of &pound;870 per annum.&nbsp; In 1865 the
London and South Western Railway treated for and subsequently
purchased a part of the estate, 5 acres 2 roods 5 perches in
extent, for the sum of &pound;10,000, which reduced the rent of
the estate from &pound;870 to &pound;485 per annum.</p>
<p>This sum of &pound;10,000 was for some time invested in
consols, but in 1887 was reinvested in the purchase of ground
rents in the city of London.</p>
<p>In 1874 a portion of Butt&rsquo;s Fields was sold to the Duke
of Bedford for the sum of &pound;18,500 (a very good price you
will think) for the site of Thorney <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>House at the corner of Gloucester
Road.&nbsp; In 1875 a further portion of the estate, being 12 and
13, Hyde Park Gate, was sold to Mr. James Watney, M.P., for
&pound;22,500.&nbsp; Both of these amounts were at first invested
in consols, but have since been invested in the purchase of a
freehold estate in the city called Thanet House, and in ground
rents in the city.</p>
<p>In 1869 the Gravel Pits Estate was let on a building lease for
ninety-nine years at a rent of &pound;1,040 per annum, when
Clanricarde Gardens, and Nos. 2, 4, 8, 10 and 12, High Street,
Notting Hill, were erected thereon.&nbsp; And advantageous leases
of the remaining land were made at greatly increased rentals from
time to time as opportunity occurred.</p>
<p>Such being the case, and the trustees being hampered by that
curious order of the Court of December, 1852, it was clear that
the time had arrived when the affairs of the charity should be
placed upon a footing consonant with its increased income and the
greater population of the parish.&nbsp; Accordingly, application
was made to the Charity Commissioners, who have been provided by
the legislature with powers in that respect, and in 1879 that
body made an order vesting the lands in the official trustee of
charity lands, and approved a scheme prepared under their
superintendence, altering the qualification for the office of
trustee of the charity, defining the duties and powers of the
trustees, and directing the application of the income of the
charity.&nbsp; That scheme, which has since been the subject of
some further orders, is practically, but not without some
important modifications, the same as the one now in force, which
I will state at length presently.</p>
<p>But at the time it was objected to considerably, and at a
meeting of ratepayers held on the 3rd August, 1879, at the Vestry
Hall, it was resolved to petition the Court against it, on the
grounds principally that it limited the amounts payable in
pensions and to be applied for apprenticing poor boys, and that
it abrogated the order of the Court of the 23rd December, 1852,
apportioning the distribution of the funds among the districts of
the various churches; and a petition against the scheme was
presented to the Court.&nbsp; Vice-Chancellor Hall was impressed
by the arguments for the petitioners, and set aside the scheme,
but the Charity Commissioners appealed, and the Court of Appeal,
presided over by the late Master of the Rolls, confirmed the
order of the Charity Commission, and, in his judgment, made some
remarks of so generally interesting and important a character
that I regret time does not permit me to read them to you.&nbsp;
You will, however, find them recorded in vol. 45 of the
&ldquo;Law Times Reports,&rdquo; at page 158.</p>
<p>The decision was given on, the 27th May, 1881, and accordingly
the affairs of the charity were, up to the 4th of March, 1890,
regulated by that order.</p>
<p>But on the 4th March, 1890, the Charity Commissioners, on the
application of the trustees of the charity, made another order,
which is the one now in force.&nbsp; It is practically the same,
with some important additions, as that approved by the Court of
Appeal in 1881.&nbsp; I now state it fully, so that you all may
learn how the affairs of the charity are regulated.</p>
<p>The charity is managed by eighteen competent persons as
trustees, viz.:&mdash;Three <i>ex-officio</i>, six
representative, nine co-optative.</p>
<p>The three <i>ex-officio</i> trustees are the Vicar and
Churchwardens for the time being of the parish of Kensington.</p>
<p>The six representative trustees are elected&mdash;two by the
Vestry of Kensington; two by the Board of Guardians of the poor
of the parish; two by the members of the School Board for London
for the Division of Chelsea.</p>
<p>The co-optative trustees must be persons residing or carrying
on business in the parish of Kensington, and are to be
provisionally appointed by the trustees, which appointment must
be approved by the Charity Commissioners before it is valid.</p>
<p>The representative trustees are appointed for five years, and
the co-optative trustees for seven years.</p>
<p>The income of the charity is to be applied as
follows:&mdash;1st, in the payment of the pensions and
apprenticeship fees granted before the 27th May, 1881.</p>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>The
income is then divided into two portions.</p>
<p>One-half of the income, after providing for these old
pensions, is to be applied in charitable or eleemosynary purposes
as follows:&mdash;(1) An annual sum of not more than &pound;900
nor less than &pound;700 in the payment of pensions to deserving
and necessitous inhabitants of the parish of Kensington, who
shall have resided therein for not less than seven years next
preceding the time of their appointment, who shall not during
that period have received poor law relief, and who from age,
ill-health, accident, or infirmity shall be unable to maintain
themselves by their own exertions.</p>
<p>(2) The remainder of the half, after paying the &pound;900
applicable to pensions, to the general benefit of the poor of
Kensington, to such persons and in such way as the trustees shall
consider most advantageous to the recipients and most conducive
to the formation of provident habits, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>1. (<i>a</i>) Subscriptions in aid of the funds of any
dispensary, infirmary, hospital, or convalescent home, upon such
terms as to enable the trustees to secure the benefit of the
institution for the objects of the charities.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To provident clubs or societies in the parish of
Kensington for the supply of coal, clothes, or other
necessaries.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Contributions towards</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The provision of nurses for the sick and
infirm.</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The purchase of annuities for the augmentation of
any income possessed by the recipients and produced by their own
exertions.</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) The cost of outfit, on entering into trade or
service, of any one under 21 years of age.</p>
<p>(<i>d</i>) Passage money and outfit in aid of emigration.</p>
<p>(<i>e</i>) Maintenance of any reading-room, library, or
working man&rsquo;s club for the benefit of the parish.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The temporary relief in money by way of loan or
otherwise to an amount not exceeding &pound;200 in one year in
case of unexpected loss, temporary illness, or sudden
destitution.&nbsp; The pensions above mentioned are not to be
less than &pound;10 and not more than &pound;26 a-year.</p>
<p>The other half of the income of the charities is to be applied
to educational purposes:&mdash;</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) In payments for the education of the children of
poor inhabitants of the parish who are deaf and dumb or blind, or
suffering from physical or mental infirmity, and who thereby
aggravate the difficulties of their parents or guardians; and</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) To the advancement of children who are
<i>bon&acirc; fide</i> residents in Kensington, who have been
scholars in a public elementary school, and who have received
certificates of good conduct from the managers, in the following
ways:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1) In apprenticing children who have attended school for five
years, and in providing a suitable outfit.</p>
<p>The apprenticeship premium is not to exceed &pound;30.</p>
<p>(2) In payments not exceeding &pound;10 a-year for the benefit
of children who have attended school for not less than five
years, and who have attained a standard which releases them from
compulsory attendance.&nbsp; Such payment to be made only while
the child regularly attends a public elementary school.</p>
<p>(3) Exhibitions for higher education of &pound;30 a-year for
five years.</p>
<p>(4) In providing lectures and classes for the benefit of
scholars who are attending or have attended any public elementary
school in Kensington.</p>
<p>The trustees have power to raise and expend &pound;50,000 in a
building for the purpose of such lectures or classes.</p>
<p>The trustees may give rewards of &pound;5 to apprentices for
distinguished merit.</p>
<p>The trustees are bound, in administering the funds, to have
regard to the wants of the poor of every part of the parish of
Kensington, and to satisfy themselves that in each case the
beneficiaries are, in respect of poverty and <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>character,
deserving of help.&nbsp; And no part of the income is ever to be
applied, directly or indirectly, in aid of the poor rate of the
parish.</p>
<p>I hope you notice the anxious and thoughtful care which has
been taken to secure that the funds shall be properly
administered in accordance with the true intention of the
original donors, and with the needs and circumstances of the
parish at the present time.</p>
<p>The gross annual income of the Campden Charity is now the
magnificent sum of &pound;4,382 19<i>s.</i>, all derived from the
original investment of &pound;465 in land in the middle of the
17th century.</p>
<p>I have pursued the interesting subject of the Campden
Charities as long as the time at our disposal will permit, and
your patience can endure.&nbsp; I only wish further to impress
upon you that the charity has an office at the Vestry Hall,
Kensington, and a clerk, Mr. R. C. Green, to whom all
applications can be made, and who is ready at all times to give
information to anyone properly applying to him for the same.</p>
<p>Those of you who care to go further into the subject, I
recommend to obtain the last annual report of the trustees, and
to carefully peruse the same.</p>
<p>Some of the most interesting work done under the auspices of
the trustees is that of the handicraft classes, both for boys and
girls, in which practical instruction and carpentering for the
one, and cookery and dressmaking and mending for the other, has
for some time been given at S. Clement&rsquo;s Mission Room and
All Saints&rsquo; School Room.</p>
<p>And I think that the powers lately given to the trustees to
provide a building and equipment for technical education have
already been exercised, and active steps are being taken for its
establishment amongst us.</p>
<p>Before finally leaving the subject, I may mention that in the
year 1889 there were paid &pound;570 in old pensions;
&pound;1,566 on the first head of pensions and charitable aid;
and &pound;1,566 on the second head for education and
apprenticeship.</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;METHWOLD&rsquo;S AND OTHER CHARITIES.</h3>
<p>In 1652 Mr. William Methwold by will gave six cottages or
almshouses, in the will called &ldquo;an hospital,&rdquo; to form
residences for six poor women.</p>
<p>These almshouses were situated in what is now called Cromwell
Lane, and adjoined a house and grounds called Hale House, which
had been owned and occupied by Mr. Methwold; and this house was
charged with the payment of &pound;24 a year to give a pension or
subsistence money of &pound;4 a year each to six alms-women by
quarterly payments of &pound;1, at Hale House.</p>
<p>The will provided that the parish in Vestry were to appoint
three alms women to the three western houses, and the owner or
inhabitant of Hale House for the time being to appoint to the
three eastern houses.</p>
<p>The alms women were to be single, aged 50, free from vice and
of good report, were not to be allowed to receive lodgers, and
were to visit and assist one another in sickness.</p>
<p>Difficulties occurred in executing the provisions of the will,
necessitating an application to the Court of Chancery, and by a
decree of the Court dated 17th July, 1758, the charity was
established according to the will, except that the rent charge
upon Hale House of &pound;26 a year for pensions was reduced to
&pound;18.&nbsp; The charity continued in this condition for a
great number of years, and the rent charge duly paid by the
proprietors of the Hale House Estate, who in 1810 were the
Countess of Harrington and Lady Fleming, both descended from John
Fleming, the purchaser of Hale House from the Methwold
family.</p>
<p>The committee of 1810, in their report of which I have made so
much use in preparing this paper, point out the necessity for a
very careful and vigilant attention in the selection for the
benefits of this charity, from that class of respectable poor
&ldquo;who may justly be entitled to accommodation of this
kind,&rdquo; and the report quaintly proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The committee do this the rather as the
charity has been for many years past shamefully abused by a woman
in one of the <i>eastern</i> houses, who has suffered a man to
reside with her in direct violation of one of the express rules
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>of the
original foundation, and in defiance of repeated remonstrances to
the contrary.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas Goodfellow, by his will dated 1597, gave a rent charge
of 20<i>s.</i> a year out of the same property as that charged by
Methwold to be paid annually to the Vicar and Churchwardens of
Kensington, and this bequest was duly established of the same
decree of the Court as established Methwold&rsquo;s gift.</p>
<p>The Methwold&rsquo;s almshouses continued to exist until about
1871, when both the almshouses and the Hale House Estate, out of
which the rent charges were paid, were compulsorily acquired by
the Metropolitan Railway Company, who paid a large sum to the
vestry for the purchase thereof.&nbsp; This put an end to the
almshouses.&nbsp; The money received from the purchase was
invested in Government stock, and now consists of the sum of
&pound;4,922 11<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> 2&frac34; per cent.
consolidated stock, purchased for &pound;4,563 4<i>s.</i>
9<i>d.</i> in cash.&nbsp; Application was then made to the
Charity Commissioners for an order establishing a scheme for the
future regulation of the charity, which was accordingly adopted,
viz.:&mdash;That the net income of the charity be applied in
pensioning poor widows or single women of good character and
reputation, and not less than 60 years of age, whose income from
all sources does not exceed &pound;30 a year, who have resided in
the parish for not less than ten years, and have never received
parochial relief.</p>
<p>These pensioners are appointed by the Vestry.&nbsp; It appears
from the Vestry report of 1888&ndash;9 that there were then seven
women, whose ages varied from 78 to 84, in receipt of pensions
from this fund, amounting in the aggregate to &pound;118
6<i>s.</i></p>
<p>I now come to various other gifts of small amounts, most of
them of very great antiquity, to the poor of the parish of
Kensington, to all except one of which the following remark
applies:&mdash;These were gifts to secure which the donors
charged specific sums annually upon certain properties, or left
specific amounts of Government stock.</p>
<p>They were not gifts of land or of money which could be or was,
except in one case, applied in the purchase of real
property.&nbsp; Consequently the parish has not derived the
benefit from the marvellous increase of value in lands due to the
modern development of the parish which has happened in the case
of the Campden bequests.</p>
<p>In 1560 Thomas Young gave for the use of the poor of the
parish a rent charge of 20<i>s.</i> a year, and of two houses in
High Street, Kensington, occupied in 1810 by Mr. Gunton, a
plumber, and Mr. Cock, a shoemaker.&nbsp; I have not been able to
trace all the vicissitudes of this gift, but I now find it
converted into &pound;37 18<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> consuls, from
which a yearly dividend of 11<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> only is
derived, so that this gift, instead of increasing in value to the
poor of the parish since 1560, has actually decreased.</p>
<p>In 1617 Lady Berkeley charged a house at Kensington Gravel
Pits with a rent charge of &pound;10 a year, payable half-yearly,
to be disposed of by the Vicar, Churchwardens, and Overseers of
the poor within ten days after being received, &ldquo;to, and
amongst, and for the benefit of the most <i>aged</i> and
<i>impotent</i> poor of the parish as they should see
convenient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1658 Thomas Sams left a rent charge of &pound;5 a year
charged upon property in Church Lane and Holland Street, to be
distributed among the poor of Kensington by the Vicar,
Churchwardens, and Overseers, and this has ever since been
regularly paid and distributed.&nbsp; I see that in March in the
year 1890 it produced the sum of &pound;4 16<i>s.</i>
10<i>d.</i>, so this is another instance of a standstill
property.</p>
<p>In 1805 Mary Carnaby left &pound;40 for the use of the poor,
and in 1707 the parish officers with &pound;80, &pound;30 of
which was out of Mary Carnaby&rsquo;s &pound;40, and the
remaining &pound;50 was a gift by Catherine Dickens in 1702, for
the specific purpose of education (as to which I shall have
something to say presently) purchased the freehold of the
&ldquo;Goat&rdquo; public house in the High Street in trust as to
three-eighths of the rent to be distributed among the poor.&nbsp;
The &ldquo;Goat&rdquo; public house still remains, and
three-eighths of the rent now amounts to &pound;54 12<i>s.</i>
1<i>d.</i>, which is another instance of how profitable early
investments of land in the parish have proved.</p>
<p><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>In 1794
James Mackintosh, by will, directed his wife to transfer
&pound;100 4 per cent. annuities to the Vicar and Churchwardens
of the parish, for them &ldquo;to apply the dividends thereof
every Christmas in the purchase of coals, or bread, or both, for
the relief of ten poor families of the parish who did not receive
alms, as they from time to time may think most
deserving.&rdquo;&nbsp; This stock was duly transferred, and now
consists of &pound;105 consols, the dividend on which is &pound;3
18<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>
<p>In 1798 Thomas Reeves, by will, gave to the Vicar,
Churchwardens and Overseers &pound;100 5 per cent. bank
annuities, to apply the dividends thereof &ldquo;unto and for the
use of, and benefit of, the poor and indigent people,
parishioners of Kensington, yearly for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This bequest now consists of &pound;110 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
consols, the annual dividend upon which amounts to &pound;4
2<i>s.</i></p>
<p>In 1832 Elizabeth Ramsden left &pound;500 reduced 3 per cent.
stock, the dividend on which was to be applied in keeping in
order a tomb and tablets in the parish churchyard and church, and
the balance to be applied for the benefit of the poor of the
parish.</p>
<p>In 1837 Mary Barnard made a gift on similar conditions, which
is now represented by &pound;110 7<i>s.</i> consols producing an
annual dividend of &pound;2 14<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i></p>
<p>The application of all the above gifts is regulated by the
order of the Court of Chancery, dated 23rd December, 1853, to
which I referred just now when dealing with the Campden bequests,
and which as regards those was (as it appears to me) fortunately
abrogated by the decree of the Court of Appeal on the 27th May,
1881, putting those charities upon their present admirable
basis.</p>
<p>According to this decree of 1853, the income from the gifts I
have just been detailing has to be divided into eighty-eight
parts as follows:&mdash;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right">25</p>
</td>
<td><p>88ths to S. Mary Abbot&rsquo;s district,</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right">9</p>
</td>
<td><p>88ths to S. Barnabas,</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right">21</p>
</td>
<td><p>88ths to Holy Trinity, Brompton,</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right">6&frac12;</p>
</td>
<td><p>88ths to S. Mary Boltons,</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right">17</p>
</td>
<td><p>88ths to S. John&rsquo;s, Notting Hill,</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: right">9&frac12;</p>
</td>
<td><p>88ths to S. James&rsquo;, Norland,</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>and their respective proportions are distributed to the poor
of these districts by the Incumbents and Churchwardens of each
district.</p>
<p>The income from these gifts during the year ending Easter,
1890, was &pound;93 8<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i></p>
<p>I for one venture to doubt whether this method of distribution
is the best possible.</p>
<p>In the first place it is altogether disproportionate to the
present population and to the localities now inhabited by the
poor residents in the parish.&nbsp; As we all know, a larger
proportion both of population and poor now reside in that part of
the parish north of the Uxbridge Road, yet the districts of S.
John&rsquo;s, Notting Hill, and S. James&rsquo;, Norland, which
according to the order in question occupy the whole of the
northern part I am alluding to, receive only 26&frac12; 88ths,
which for the year ending Easter, 1890, amounted to &pound;28
1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, far less than their due proportion.</p>
<p>Then there is needless complication in dividing the income
into eighty-eight parts, splitting it up into small proportions,
so that it reaches the hands of those who have to distribute it
in driblets, giving an amount of trouble and anxiety out of all
proportion to the importance of the sums, or the benefit to those
receiving them.</p>
<p>I for one venture to think it would be much better to hand
over all the property now representing these gifts to the Charity
Commissioners and the Campden Trustees, to be dealt with by the
latter in the same manner as that portion of their fund allocated
to charitable purposes as distinguished from educational ones are
applied.</p>
<p>There are also some other gifts more recently bequeathed,
which are distributed to special purposes as directed by the
donors.&nbsp; These are:&mdash;</p>
<p>In 1840 Mr. Searle bequeathed &pound;300 consols the dividends
on which are <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>distributed by the Vicar and Churchwardens among poor
women, sixty years and upwards of age in single &pound;1&rsquo;s
(pounds sterling) or as near thereto as possible.</p>
<p>In 1851 Mr. Shore bequeathed &pound;120 9<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>,
new &pound;3 per cents. the dividends on which are distributed by
the Churchwardens and Overseers in bread and coals, or both, but
not in money.</p>
<p>In 1867 Mr. Haine bequeathed &pound;300 consols, the dividends
on which after defraying the costs of cleaning and restoring the
donor&rsquo;s tomb every second year, are distributed by the
Vicar and Churchwardens in the same manner as Mr. Shore&rsquo;s
gift.</p>
<p>In 1885 Mr. Thomas Blewitt bequeathed &pound;1,000 to the
Vicar and Churchwardens, which was invested in the purchase of
&pound;997 10<i>s.</i> 2&frac34;<i>d.</i> consols, the dividends
in which are first applied to the maintenance of the
testator&rsquo;s grave in the Kensington Cemetery at Hanwell, and
the gravestones of his ancestors in Kensington Churchyard; and
the balance applied for the benefit of six of the oldest and most
deserving poor widows in the parish.&nbsp; It is gratifying to
know that from this bequest the sum of &pound;26 6<i>s.</i>
11<i>d.</i> was so applied during the year ending Easter,
1890.</p>
<p>I have attached to this paper the account showing the
application of the income of these charities during the year
ending Easter, 1890.&nbsp; But the unsuitableness to modern times
of the prescribed method of distribution of these charities
clearly appears from these accounts.&nbsp; When I tell you that
five separate gentlemen distributed, one the sum of 14<i>s.</i>,
and the four others 13<i>s.</i> each in that year I think you
will agree with me that it will be better to place these
charities upon a more sensible footing.</p>
<h3>KENSINGTON PAROCHIAL CHARITIES.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Year ended Easter</i>, 1890.</p>

<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>I must
now hurry on to the three remaining endowed charities of
Kensington.</p>
<p>The first is the Charity known as Leech and Aisley&rsquo;s
Trusts.</p>
<p>Margaret Leech, a lady residing in Kensington Square, by her
will dated in the year 1799, gave &pound;1000 6 per cent. bank
annuities to five trustees, of whom the then Vicar was one, in
trust to apply the interest thereof &ldquo;in the maintenance,
clothing, and instruction of so many female children as it would
be sufficient to so provide for; such children being parishioners
of Kensington whose fathers and mothers, and grandfathers and
grandmothers should have been seven years successively
housekeepers, or employed as servants in the parish, and have
been three years in the same service.&rdquo;&nbsp; The children
to be appointed by the trustees, and not to be less than seven
years of age when admitted, nor to be continued after attaining
fifteen years.&nbsp; The interest always to remain a separate
stock, and not to be applied to any other purpose, and the
charity always to remain a distinct foundation, but the children
might be placed in any other charitable institution, but so as
always to be distinguished as children of this foundation.</p>
<p>This charity, as you have perceived, is for the benefit of
girls.</p>
<p>Stephen Aisley, by his will dated 1805, gave so much money
arising from the realisation on his personal estate as would,
when invested in accordance with the directions in the will,
produce an annual income of &pound;30 a year, to five trustees,
of whom the Vicar was one, &ldquo;in trust for the apprenticing
of boys from the Charity School of Kensington, of the boarding
establishment only, to be selected by the trustees of his
will.&nbsp; The &pound;30 a year to be considered a separate
fund, and not to be applied to any other purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You will notice the resemblance of these two bequests.&nbsp;
It would seem as though the respective testators had been
acquaintances, and had talked the matter over between themselves;
and that Mrs. Leech had resolved to benefit some of the poor
girls of the parish, while Mr. Aisley, on the other hand,
determined in a similar manner to benefit some poor boys.&nbsp;
You will also notice how strongly both testators insisted that
these funds should for ever remain separate foundations, and
should never be mixed with any other.&nbsp; If their intention
was to keep up the memory of their names it has succeeded, for
the Leech and Aisley Charity, established so long ago, remains to
this day under the same name, and the funds are still applied as
the testators directed.</p>
<p>These bequests were the subject of an order of the Charity
Commissioners of the 13th July, 1880, by which the funds of both
were vested in the Official Trustees of Charitable Funds, and
which regulates their present application.&nbsp; It appears from
this order that the property of Leech&rsquo;s Charity then
consisted of &pound;1,477 19<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> new 3 per
cents. and that of Aisley&rsquo;s Charity of &pound;1,352
12<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> consols.</p>
<p>The order provided that both charities were in future to be
administered by seven trustees&mdash;three official, namely, the
Vicar and Churchwardens of Kensington for the time being; and
four more non-official, who were to be appointed from competent
persons resident in Kensington, whose credentials should be
satisfactory to the Charity Commissioners.</p>
<p>The order directs that the dividends arising from the
&pound;1,477 19<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> new three per cents,
representing Margaret Leech&rsquo;s bequest, shall be applied in
the &ldquo;maintenance, clothing, and support of girls, daughters
of deserving persons resident in Kensington, who are inmates of
the Girls&rsquo; Industrial School established in the parish, and
in providing such girls with suitable outfits upon their leaving
school and entering domestic service, or otherwise for their
benefit or advancement in life; provided that in case the
trustees shall at any time consider that a girl not in the said
school, but being the child of a poor inhabitant of the parish,
is a more suitable object for the charity, such girl may be
selected.&rdquo;&nbsp; You will notice with what tenderness the
directions of Mrs. Leech are treated and how closely they are
followed in the order.</p>
<p>The Industrial School for Girls mentioned in the order does
not come within the scope of my paper, since, as far as I am able
to learn, it has never become an endowed charity.&nbsp; It is an
excellent institution, established in 1858, with the object of
providing education and a home for girls, who &ldquo;either from
evil <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>example, extreme poverty, or the death of their parents,
are exposed to temptation,&rdquo; and supported entirely by
voluntary contributions.&nbsp; The institution was formerly
carried on at 2, Bullingham Place, Church Street, and is now
merged into the Kensington Training School for Girls, at 3,
Church Street.</p>
<p>It still subsists almost entirely on voluntary contribution,
its only settled income amounting to &pound;13 9<i>s.</i>
1<i>d.</i> a-year, and is an institution which deserves
support.&nbsp; I trust that some charitable person may hear of or
see this paper, and thus be induced to place the Kensington
Training School for Girls among the endowed charities of
Kensington by bestowing, preferably in his lifetime, but at all
events by will, a handsome endowment upon it.</p>
<p>It appears from the accounts of Leech&rsquo;s Charity for the
year 1890, which I have seen, that its income for that year was
&pound;40 13<i>s.</i>, and with that, and a balance from the
preceding year, it paid the sum of &pound;44 5<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i> to the Kensington Training School for Girls for the
support of girls within that institution, in strict accordance
with the directions of the donor, and the order of the Charity
Commissioners.</p>
<p>This order, as regards Aisley&rsquo;s Charity, directed that
the dividends from the &pound;1,352 12<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>
consols belonging to the charity should be applied in the payment
&ldquo;of exhibitions to boys of the yearly value not exceeding
&pound;15 a-year to boys educated at one of the public elementary
schools in the parish, either in the situation of pupil teachers,
or to assist their education at some school higher than
elementary, or of technical or professional
instruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have also examined the accounts of Aisley&rsquo;s Charity
for the year 1890, and I find during that year the income of the
charity was &pound;37 5<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, out of which, and
from a balance of &pound;46 9<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i> from preceding
years, exhibitions of varying value were paid to five boys at
various schools.</p>
<p>I have next to deal with a charity as to which there was, at
the time I prepared this paper, a singular absence of
information.&nbsp; It is called the District School, carried on
in Jenning&rsquo;s Buildings.&nbsp; Jenning&rsquo;s Buildings, if
I remember rightly, was a rookery in Kensington, and removed to
make way for Baron Grant&rsquo;s house, since in its turn pulled
down, and its site occupied by Kensington Court.</p>
<p>Since this lecture was delivered, Mr. J. J. Merriman, of 45,
Kensington Square, one of the most respected and distinguished of
Kensington parishioners, has most kindly given me full
information as to these Jenning&rsquo;s Buildings Schools.&nbsp;
Jenning&rsquo;s Buildings are thus described in the Report for
the year 1853, of the S. Mary Abbot&rsquo;s Kensington District
Visiting Society:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jenning&rsquo;s Buildings is a portion of
the town leading out of the High Street, and is the chosen
settlement of the Irish Romanists.&nbsp; It consists of a series
of courts and alleys, which, for closeness and filth, are
probably without a parallel westward of S. Paul&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Being a <i>cul de sac</i>, unlighted, irregularly-paved, and
indifferently supplied with water, its best-disposed inhabitants
find it difficult to cultivate the habits of civilized
life.&nbsp; The majority give the matter up, and seek in
alcoholic and other stimulants an antidote against wretchedness,
malaria, and disease.&nbsp; Nowhere are the evils of overcrowded
chambers more apparent.&nbsp; Single rooms frequently shelter two
and even three families.&nbsp; Its choicest district exhibits a
return of 40 families to 18 houses; of 160 persons, exclusive of
lodgers, sleeping in 39 rooms.&nbsp; The entire population must
exceed 1,500 souls.&nbsp; Prior to the erection of the present
schools it was impossible for ladies to penetrate its
recesses.&nbsp; The police entered its retreats in couples.&nbsp;
In 1847 the work of reformation commenced, and since then a
steady progress has been made.&nbsp; At first the school was
emphatically &lsquo;a ragged school;&rsquo; its scholars were
literally running wild and half-naked in the streets; they
outraged alike propriety and decency.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The modern inhabitants of Kensington, especially those
residing in its not least-favoured spot, Kensington Court, will
have a difficulty in believing what is nevertheless the fact,
that the above was a truthful description of the state in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1853 of the spot now occupied by the
mansions and gardens of Kensington Court.</p>
<p>Jenning&rsquo;s Buildings School was the outcome of the
earnest efforts of a few <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Kensingtonians of those days, headed
by that great and good man, Archdeacon Sinclair, to deal with
this sad condition of things.</p>
<p>By voluntary contributions the school was established and
carried on, and there, from 1847 to 1874, devoted men and women
laboured amongst the poor Irish for their improvement, physical,
mental, moral, and religious, with success.</p>
<p>In 1874 Baron Grant obtained the site of this rookery, and
thereon erected the palace, destined to be so shortly afterwards
demolished and replaced by Kensington Court, and the former
inhabitants of the rookery dispersed, many of them to take refuge
in the potteries in the northern part of the parish.&nbsp; The
Jenning&rsquo;s Buildings Schools were pulled down.&nbsp;
Accommodation for those of the children remaining was found in
the Parish National Schools, and out of the money received from
Baron Grant on the purchase of the site, which was received by
the Charity Commissioners, &pound;1,600 was paid to the manager
of the Parish National Schools by the Charity Commissioners, on
the twofold condition that those schools should be worked in
accordance with the 7th section of the Education Act of 1870, and
should provide accommodation for the children of the
Jenning&rsquo;s Buildings class.</p>
<p>The balance of the money received by the Charity Commissioners
from Baron Grant for the site of the Jenning&rsquo;s Buildings
Schools, remained unappropriated in the hands of the Charity
Commissioners until last year, when the attention of the manager
of the Parish Schools was called to the fact by one of the
officials in the office of the Charity Commission, who is a
member of the congregation of S. Mary Abbots.&nbsp; A scheme was
thereupon prepared, and an order of the Charity Commissioners,
dated the 21st November, 1890, was made on the application of the
Vicar and Churchwardens (the trustees of the charity), reciting
that the property of the charity is the sum of &pound;343
3<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i> two and threequarter per cent. consols,
standing in the names of the official trustees of charitable
funds.&nbsp; And the order provided that the income of the
charity is to be applied in payments of not more than &pound;8 a
year each to the advancement of the education of children
attending public elementary schools, and in payments to encourage
continuance at school.&nbsp; The money may be applied towards
paying the tuition fees of the child, or it may be deposited in a
savings bank for the benefit of the child, or otherwise applied
for his or her benefit.</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;THE NATIONAL SCHOOL.</h3>
<p>I now come to the only remaining charity of which I propose to
treat, which is that now representing the old Parish Free
Schools, viz., the well known schools in Church Court, adjoining
the parish church of S. Mary Abbots, now called the National and
Infant Schools.</p>
<p>The first endowment to this charity dates from so long ago as
1645, when Roger Pimble gave by will two houses in High Street,
Kensington, held under a lease from Brazenose College, Oxford,
for &ldquo;a salary for the maintenance of a free school in
Kensington for poor men&rsquo;s children in the said town to be
taught.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1652 the parish purchased the leases of the
&ldquo;Catherine Wheel&rdquo; public house and a small plot of
land adjoining, which were accordingly conveyed to the
Churchwardens and Overseers, and other parishioners, for the use
of the parish; and in 1664 the freehold of these premises was
granted by the Lady of the Manor of Abbots, Kensington, to
Christopher Batt and others in trust &ldquo;for the perpetual
habitation of a schoolmaster; for the education, teaching and
instruction of poor boys and youths of the parish of Kensington
in the same messuage;&rdquo; and the said schoolmaster was to be
chosen by the parishioners and inhabitants, or the majority of
them.</p>
<p>Catherine Dickens by will made in 1702 gave &pound;50 to the
Vicar and Churchwardens, the income thereof to be applied for
ever &ldquo;for the further maintenance of a schoolmaster
belonging to the said parish, for teaching such poor children to
write and cast accounts, whose parents being inhabitants of this
parish were not able to pay for the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>In 1705
Mary Carnaby, as I have already mentioned, left &pound;40 for the
use of the poor.</p>
<p>And in 1707 the Parish Officers, with &pound;80 made up of Mr.
Dicken&rsquo;s &pound;50 and &pound;30 out of Mary
Carnaby&rsquo;s &pound;40, purchased the freehold of the
&ldquo;Goat&rdquo; public house in High Street, which was
accordingly conveyed to trustees on trust as to fire-eighths of
the rent for the further and better maintenance of the said
schoolmaster, and as to three-eighths &ldquo;to be distributed
among the poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these endowments a school was established; there was a
building in which instruction was given and a salary provided to
pay a schoolmaster by whom the instruction was to be given.</p>
<p>The history of the charity thus just established now becomes
very intricate, and it would exhaust your patience still more,
without serving any countervailing useful purpose, were I to
attempt to follow the whole matter in detail.&nbsp; I will
therefore spare you all this, and content myself, and I hope my
hearers, by calling your attention to the more important
events.</p>
<p>In 1707 a charity school was established in accordance with
the notions of those days, in which 30 boys and 20 girls were
instructed, and were also clothed in an uniform at the expense of
the charity, but were not lodged or fed, except by a dinner on
Sundays to secure their attendance at church.&nbsp; This object
was attained by applying for subscriptions, and it was then that
the Royal bounty which the schools have up to the present
received was first granted, Queen Anne granting &pound;50 a-year,
and Prince George of Denmark her husband, &pound;30 a-year.&nbsp;
The next step was to amalgamate the free school with the new
charity school which took place in 1709, and in 1711 the old
schoolhouse on the premises formerly occupied by the
&ldquo;Catherine Wheel&rdquo; public house was pulled down and a
new one erected, and was first used in August, 1712.&nbsp; The
subscriptions collected for the building were more than
sufficient for the purpose, as were also those for the carrying
on the school, and the surplus was from time to time invested,
first in East India bonds, and afterwards in South Sea
annuities.</p>
<p>Thomas Smith, and his son in 1721, left a house adjoining the
school premises in trust for the habitation of a
schoolmaster.</p>
<p>In 1732 the Rev. Dr. Millington, the then Vicar of Kensington,
devised one-third of the rent of some land at Acton to trustees
for the use of the Charity School; and some other small gifts
were from time to time made to the charity.</p>
<p>In 1769 a Mrs. Randolph bequeathed, or gave in her lifetime, a
sum of &pound;275 to the schools, which appears to have been
invested in South Sea Stock.</p>
<p>Another benefactor to the parish was Mr. John Farmer, who died
on the 9th November, 1803, bequeathing his portrait to the
schoolhouse, in the modern representative of which it still
hangs, and assists the school committee in their labours by
beaming upon them from the wall of the school committee room, and
a sum of &pound;500, together with the proceeds of the sale of
his household furniture and pictures, saving the aforesaid
portrait.&nbsp; The furniture produced &pound;400, making Mr.
Farmer&rsquo;s, benefaction amount in money to &pound;900, and
the whole appears to have been invested in South Sea Stock.</p>
<p>At the date of the report of 1810, to which I have frequently
alluded, the property of the charity consisted of the school
premises, occupying an important site in the main road, two sums
of South Sea stock, amounting to &pound;2,275 and &pound;925
each, the Royal bounty, five-eighths of the rent of the
&ldquo;Goat&rdquo; public-house, and the rent of the land at
Acton given by Dr. Millington.&nbsp; And the committee
recommended that some children be boarded and longed as well as
educated, and that more be educated, and that the title be
changed from &ldquo;Charity School&rdquo; to that of &ldquo;Free
School.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The school premises erected in 1712 by means of the
subscriptions to which allusion was just now made, was long one
of the glories of Kensington.&nbsp; It was designed by Sir John
Vanbrugh, the constructor of Blenheim Palace, and the fashionable
architect of his time.&nbsp; Sir John was also known as a great
and successful courtier, as well as a dramatic author and poet of
somewhat doubtful reputation.&nbsp; Many of us are in a position
to criticise from memory one at least of his works, viz., the
front of these Kensington National Schools, which stood until
removed to make way for the new Town Hall.&nbsp; There were
figures of a <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>charity boy and girl in the costume of the period
decorating the front.&nbsp; Sir John Vanbrugh seems to have
satisfied the taste not only of his own but of some succeeding
generations with this building, for Faulkner, writing in 1820,
speaks of it in terms of high praise, and makes a boast of
Kensington possessing it, but I must confess I personally never
admired it, and am far from regretting its destruction.</p>
<p>Following on the recommendation of the committee of 1810, the
charity was reconstructed.&nbsp; New schoolrooms were built,
still behind Sir John&rsquo;s front, which were first opened in
June, 1818, on the National system of education which had been
first established in the parish in 1809.&nbsp; In August, 1819,
according to Faulkner, there were 140 boys and 100 girls in the
school, the whole of whom were taught by one master and one
mistress, without any assistants.&nbsp; Mark that, ye
moderns!&nbsp; 70 girls were clothed, but only 12 boys.&nbsp; The
children were all day scholars, the hours of attendance being
from 9 to 12, and 2 to 5 on week-days, and on Sundays twice to
church.</p>
<p>I now come to the more modern history of the Charity.&nbsp;
The older parishioners will remember the time when Archdeacon
Sinclair was Vicar, and the interest he took in the matter of the
parish schools.&nbsp; In my search for information on the subject
I applied to the Rev. Wm. Wright, now Rector of Sutton, near
Sandy, in Bedfordshire, who was for twenty years, from 1855 to
1875, senior Curate of Kensington under the Archdeacon, and who
acted as secretary to the schools all that time, and he has been
very kind in answering my questions.&nbsp; This is how Mr. Wright
describes the schools:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In 1855 there was next to the Vestry Hall
and Churchyard a large room consisting of four walls, three of
which were dead, <i>i.e.</i>, skylight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The room was divided by masonry and folding doors; on
one side was a boys&rsquo; school and on the other a girls&rsquo;
school.&nbsp; The building was hideous in the extreme, internally
and externally.&nbsp; Adjoining was a residence for teachers,
comfortless and miserable, but with a make-believe frontage to
High Street of brick work which was admired by the
&lsquo;craft&rsquo; and the antiquarians, I should say.&nbsp;
Behind this was a wretched schoolroom for infants abutting on
Church Court.&nbsp; The whole lot of building save the frontage a
miserable affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no boarding of children in my time.&nbsp;
There was free education, but leave was obtained to make a change
subject to a small free list being maintained.&nbsp; As to
clothing, there was a partial clothing of some children, but as
the uniform of charity was distasteful it was dropped, and the
saving thereof thrown into the educational fund of the
school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question of new schools arose, and what we did was,
first, to buy up the house in Church Court next to the police
station, and on the site of it build the girls&rsquo; schools. <a
name="citation16"></a><a href="#footnote16"
class="citation">[16]</a>&nbsp; This done, it was after a time
rumoured that the adjoining houses were likely to be sold for
purposes which would destroy the quiet of the schools.&nbsp; We
then, secondly, bought the houses adjoining.&nbsp; Accommodating
ourselves to the times, we had to look out for better schools,
and the thought struck us that as the wretched room in High
Street was a very valuable site for almost any other purpose in
the world than a school, we might sell it and with the proceeds
build a boys&rsquo; and infants&rsquo; school on one of the best
sites for such a thing, viz., Church Court and on the verge of
the closed churchyard.&nbsp; Accordingly we sold the school site
in High Street to the Vestry, and with the money so obtained
built the boys&rsquo; and infants&rsquo; schools.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the funds of the school: they were drawn upon to
effect the purchase of the close houses, and there were sums of
&lsquo;accumulated balances&rsquo; which were at the disposal of
the trustees for such purpose.&nbsp; Of course when the schools
were built the rents of the houses on its site were gone for
ever.&nbsp; There were other sources from which help was obtained
to aid the cause.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am sure every one interested in Kensington will feel
grateful to Mr. Wright for kindly giving us such full and
accurate information, which probably no other man now living
could have supplied.</p>
<p>Exactly according to Mr. Wright&rsquo;s recollection I find an
order of the Charity <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Commissioners dated the 15th
December, 1874, sanctioning the sale of the school site to the
Vestry of Kensington for a sum of not less than &pound;7,100.</p>
<p>This sale was effected, and upon the site was erected the new
Town Hall, which we of this generation admire as much as our
forefathers did, Sir John Vanbrugh&rsquo;s school, and we are
conceited enough to believe with far more reason.</p>
<p>The schools are now regulated, like most of the other
charities, by an order of the Charity Commissioners, dated the
13th August, 1875.</p>
<p>That order contains a schedule of the property possessed at
the date by the Charity, and it then consisted of:&mdash;</p>
<p>The sites of 3, 4, 5, and 6, Church Court, <a
name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a> forming the site of the proposed new
schools for boys and infants, and also the school buildings and
site adjoining the girls&rsquo; schools.</p>
<p>A sum of &pound;7,543 consols standing in the names of the
official trustees of charitable funds.</p>
<p>The leasehold houses bequeathed by Roger Pimble, being Nos. 51
and 53, High Street, held from Brazenose College, Oxford, for
twenty-one years, from Lady Day, 1864, at &pound;4, and underlet
at &pound;220 per annum.</p>
<p>Five-eighths of the rent of the &ldquo;Goat&rdquo; public
house, from Catherine Dicken&rsquo;s bequest.</p>
<p>The Millington land at Acton, being 5a. 0r. 7p. copyhold <a
name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a> of the Manor of Acton, let at
&pound;20 per annum.</p>
<p>A sum of &pound;421 17<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, representing a
bequest by William Briant Arundell made about the year 1830.</p>
<p>The royal bounty of &pound;73 10<i>s.</i> received from the
Commissioners of Woods and Forests in respect of an annual grant
of &pound;50 per annum by Queen Anne, and &pound;30 by Prince
George of Denmark.</p>
<p>And by this order of the Charity Commissioners of 13th
December, 1875, which is made &ldquo;in the matter of the Charity
called the National Schools in the parish of Kensington, with the
subsidiary endowments belonging thereto,&rdquo; it was
directed&mdash;</p>
<p>That the piece of ground being the site of Nos. 3, 4, 5, and
6, Church Court, should be held in trust by the Vicar and
Churchwardens of Kensington, &ldquo;to permit the premises to be
for ever appropriated and used solely as and for a school for the
instruction of children and adults of the labouring,
manufacturing, and other poorer classes of the parish of
Kensington.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such school was directed to be conducted as a public
elementary school under the 7th section of the Elementary
Education Act, 1870.</p>
<p>The management of the school is vested in a committee named by
the order, which also provides for their future appointment, and
in whom is vested the power of engaging and discharging the
teachers and regulating the attendance fees and all other
matters.</p>
<p>The school remains as constituted by this order.</p>
<p>A large sum of money was necessarily expended in the erection
and equipment of the new schools, so large that I find the income
from rents during the year ending 31st December, 1890, only
amounted to &pound;143 16<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> (which since the
charity received five-eighths of the present rent of the
&ldquo;Goat&rdquo; public house, which is &pound;150 a-year, or
the sum of &pound;93 15<i>s.</i> from that source) shows that
very little other endowment is left. <a name="citation17c"></a><a
href="#footnote17c" class="citation">[17c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>I
regret to say that I learn that the royal bounty is to be reduced
for the future to the sum of &pound;10 10<i>s.</i> a-year, the
Commissioners of Woods and Forests declining to pay any larger
sum, regulating the payments of the royal bounty by the
proportion which the contributions from the public in the parish
bears to the total property of the parish, and the proportion
which the Crown property bears to the other property in the
parish.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I hear that the land at Acton is coming in
for building, find will probably shortly be sold on advantageous
terms, or leased at an increased rent.</p>
<p>There is accommodation in these schools for 364 boys, 256
girls, and 260 infants, a total of 880.</p>
<p>The number of children attending during the year 1890 was 864,
and altogether the Kensington National Schools are an institution
of which the parish may well be proud.</p>
<p>I have now concluded the task I set myself, of endeavouring to
explain to you the endowed charities of Kensington.</p>
<p>Of course there are numberless other most admirable and
deserving charities in the parish endeavouring to provide for the
temporal and spiritual necessities of a population of 188,000
souls, but upon these neither the scope nor the limits of my
paper allow me to touch.</p>
<p>May I hope that the enumeration of all these almost
exclusively ancient charitable bequests to the parish, and the
slight survey of the good they have accomplished I have been able
to give this evening, may awake in the minds and hearts of those
possessing means a feeling of emulation with their ancestors, and
lead them by adding to the endowments of the existing parish
charities and by the foundation of new ones, to prove that
Kensington still deserves the reputation it has long enjoyed of
an eminently christian and charitable parish.</p>
<p>May I be permitted one word relative to myself before I sit
down: I undertook the preparation of this paper some two months
ago, at the urgent request of the Secretary of the Kensington
Ratepayers&rsquo; Association.&nbsp; I then had no idea, nor do I
think anyone else had, that I should be called upon to take an
active part in the management of these charities to which my
paper has related.</p>
<p>When in the country during the Easter holidays engaged in the
study of the charities of Kensington for the purposes of this
paper as a holiday task, I heard that I had received the
unsolicited and unexpected appointment of Churchwarden of
Kensington, and am therefore now to administer as part of my
duties the very charities of which I have been discoursing.</p>
<p>The labour of love I undertook in the preparation of this
paper will not then be thrown away after its immediate purpose
has been served, but the knowledge I have gained will greatly aid
me in the performance of my duties.</p>
<p>And may I finally conclude by saying what I am sure we all
feel and endeavour to practice, that it is the duty of every
individual to do what he can according to his opportunities on
behalf of the general cause of charity, and that by endeavouring
to ameliorate the condition of our fellow creatures, we better
and improve our own, and what is even of greater importance,
enlarge and stimulate our own hearts and sympathies.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
